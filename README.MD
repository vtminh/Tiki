Deal is a promotion offered in a limited quantity for a short period of time. Implement a screen that lists the Deals in a 2 columns grid.

On the individual grid item, you should show the product's picture, name, price and a countdown to show the time left until the end time of the Deal.

The countdown is updated on every seconds. When a countdown is finished, the item that contains the countdown must be hidden and removed from the grid.

We created the `starter` repository, it contains sample code and the `ApiService` class to help you to get deals. You can find the GitHub repository as `https://github.com/tikivn/android-home-test`.
